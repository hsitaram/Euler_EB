Firstly, download BoxLib from github.
git clone https://github.com/BoxLib-Codes/BoxLib

Correct the paths in the GNUMakefile in Euler_EB/Src.

To compile Euler_EB

cd Euler_EB/Src

adjust the GNUMakefile, set the correct compilers/options.
For instance, set USE_MPI=FALSE for serial runs.
"make" at the command prompt will probably work of the shelf.

If not, go to BoxLib/Tools/C_mk/comps and edit the compilers
Also adjust the Make.unknown in BoxLib/Tools/C_mk/sites for MPI compilation.

You will also need VisIt 2.12 for visualization.

Mac notes
=========

The original MAC gcc from command line tools does not install gfortran.

use macports to install gcc

$sudo port install gcc6
$port select --summary will tell you the package name for gcc
$port select --set gcc <packagename>

Do the same for installing openmpi-gcc6
