This is the case of supersonic flow around a sphere.

The sphere is hard coded based on an equation. Its center is
at 0.5,0.5,0.5 and has a radius of 0.25. This was one of the
first cases I tried while developing the embedded boundary solver.

To run this case, it needs EB_SPHERE defined.
Compile code using -DEB_SPHERE. Change the GNUMakefile with
DEFINES+=-DEB_SPHERE.

to run do
<executable_name> inputs_3d

for example
euler3d.gnu.ex inputs_3d

parallel example
mpirun -n 4 euler3d.gnu.MPI.ex inputs_3d
